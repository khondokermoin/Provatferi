 * Messenger is deliberately absent: its web share dialog needs a registered
 * Facebook app id and a redirect_uri, and the fb-messenger:// scheme silently
 * fails on desktop. §11 asks for it only "if technically reliable" — it is
 * not, and a button that does nothing is worse than no button. Facebook and
 * WhatsApp cover the same audience.
